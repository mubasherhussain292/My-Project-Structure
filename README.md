This is the project structure Mostly I used in projects if you find any kind of issue feel free to report issue. But still it is under the development i am working on it
This Project is built using Clean Architecture and structured as a **multi-module** project. This project leverages** Room DB** for local data storage, managed within a dedicated data module. Dependency management across modules is streamlined using Hilt, ensuring that all components receive their required dependencies automatically.

The user interface is built using** Jetpack Compose**, allowing for a modern, declarative approach to UI development. Asynchronous tasks and data streams are handled efficiently using **Coroutines** and **Flows**, ensuring a responsive and smooth user experience.

This architecture ensures a clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase, with clear separation of concerns and optimized build times, making it a robust solution for modern Android app development.
It consist of 
**Clean Architecture** : Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that separates an application's logic into distinct layers, ensuring independence between business rules, user interface, and external frameworks, promoting maintainability, scalability, and testability.
**Flows** : Flows in Kotlin are a type of cold asynchronous data stream that emit multiple values sequentially, providing a reactive programming model similar to observables.
**Coroutines** : Coroutines in Kotlin are lightweight threads that enable asynchronous programming by allowing tasks to be paused and resumed without blocking the main thread.
**Hilt** : Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that simplifies the process of providing dependencies to classes, helping to manage and inject dependencies automatically.
**Jetpack Compose** is a modern UI toolkit for Android that simplifies UI development by allowing developers to build native interfaces using a declarative approach, where the UI is defined by composable functions.
**A multi-module project** in Android development is an architectural approach where an app is divided into separate modules, each responsible for a specific feature or layer, allowing for better organization, parallel development, reusability, and faster build times.
**Room Database** : Room is an Android persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, simplifying database management and allowing for easy data access using SQL queries directly within Kotlin code.
also working on the unit testing soon I will update this project using the unit testing.

# Project Overview

This is the project structure I mostly use in my projects. If you find any issues, feel free to report them. Please note that this project is still under development, and I am actively working on it.

## Project Structure

This project is built using **Clean Architecture** and structured as a **multi-module project**. Below is an overview of the technologies and methodologies used:

- **Room Database**: This project leverages **Room DB** for local data storage, managed within a dedicated data module.
- **Hilt**: Dependency management across modules is streamlined using **Hilt**, ensuring that all components receive their required dependencies automatically.
- **Jetpack Compose**: The user interface is built using **Jetpack Compose**, allowing for a modern, declarative approach to UI development.
- **Coroutines and Flows**: Asynchronous tasks and data streams are handled efficiently using **Coroutines** and **Flows**, ensuring a responsive and smooth user experience.

This architecture ensures a clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase, with clear separation of concerns and optimized build times, making it a robust solution for modern Android app development.

## Key Concepts

### Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that separates an application's logic into distinct layers, ensuring independence between business rules, user interface, and external frameworks. This promotes maintainability, scalability, and testability.

### Flows
Flows in Kotlin are a type of cold asynchronous data stream that emit multiple values sequentially, providing a reactive programming model similar to observables.

### Coroutines
Coroutines in Kotlin are lightweight threads that enable asynchronous programming by allowing tasks to be paused and resumed without blocking the main thread.

### Hilt
Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that simplifies the process of providing dependencies to classes, helping to manage and inject dependencies automatically.

### Jetpack Compose
Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit for Android that simplifies UI development by allowing developers to build native interfaces using a declarative approach, where the UI is defined by composable functions.

### Multi-Module Project
A multi-module project in Android development is an architectural approach where an app is divided into separate modules, each responsible for a specific feature or layer. This allows for better organization, parallel development, reusability, and faster build times.

### Room Database
Room is an Android persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, simplifying database management and allowing for easy data access using SQL queries directly within Kotlin code.

## Future Work

I am currently working on adding unit testing to this project and will update the repository soon with these improvements.
